# Privacy Policy

**LKTips** is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle any information collected through the LKTips Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

- **No Personal Data Collected**: LKTips does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The extension operates entirely on your device and does not interact with any external servers.

- **Local Storage**: The extension stores user preferences (such as font size, popup color, and hover delay) locally on your device using Chrome's `storage` API. These preferences are not shared or accessible outside of your browser.

## Permissions

LKTips requires the following permissions solely to function properly:

- **Storage**: To save your preferences, such as font size, popup color, and delay settings.
- **Active Tab**: To interact with the current web page and display word translations.
- **Scripting**: To inject styles and scripts for displaying the translation popups on web pages.

These permissions are used only for the core functionality of the extension and do not involve data collection or transmission.

## How LKTips Works

- **Translations**: When you hover over or double-click on an English word, LKTips will display the Sinhala meaning. This translation is processed locally on your device using a built-in dictionary file (`dictionary.json`) and is not transmitted to any server.

## Third-Party Services

LKTips does not use or interact with any third-party services. All processing occurs locally on your device.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If changes are made, we will update the "Last Updated" date below.

**Last Updated**: September 2024
